"I looked into your future and I saw [wealth]"

A cryptocurrency tracker which collects hourly market data and social media metrics. Also evaluates the cryptos to determine which ones are likely to rise in price.

The evaluator doesn't work well. I believe the evaluation may be too difficult of a problem for myself (or anyone) to solve. This project was probably a pipe dream lol.
